## Challenge-02 Portfolio

## Description

This application was created with the intention of showcasing a portfolio that included three sections: About Me, Projects, and Contact Me. The goal was to create a navbar that included a name and linked elements that when clicked took you to the section that they were referring to (i.e., clicking "Projects" takes you the Project section). Another aspect of the application was to have images with the projects name and when clicked on they would open a new tab that would display the project (since I have only the pre-work application deployed I only linked that one). Finally, when you get to the "Contact Me" section, there would be links that when clicked would open up different ways of contacting the developer. When resizing the application, it should look as a single column that would fit a mobile device scrolling it. 

Using grids to create sidebars to match the mockup and also creating a hover effect was added into the application. variables were used in the root to help streamline a color scheme if there was alternative scheme found without having to look for the line of code for each instance of that color.
